# ADS-599-Capstone-Project-Team 2

## Personal Identifiable Information (PII) Data Detection ML Model

This project is a part of the ADS-599 Capstone course in the Applied Data Science Program at the University of San Diego.

--**Project Status:[Completed]**

## Project Intro

As the field of data science expands, the issue of safeguarding Personal Identifiable Information (PII) has become increasingly important. An individual’s data privacy can easily be violated through big data dumps, leaks, or third-party data vendor exchanges. 
Regarding education technology, known as the ed-tech industry, PII’s presence is a barrier to analyzing and creating open datasets that advance education because releasing the data publicly puts students at risk. To reduce these risks, it’s crucial to screen and cleanse educational data for PII before public release, which data science could streamline.

Usually, entire datasets are manually reviewed to scan for PII because while it is the most reliable screening method, it is also time-consuming and increases the barriers to having accessible datasets. The goal of this project is to develop a machine-learning model that can automatically detect and remove PII from student submissions. This will ultimately help facilitate public dataset creation for researchers, improving the educational tools teachers and students use.
